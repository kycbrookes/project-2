		<h1>Hi, I’m Kyle.</h1>
		<p>I’m a music producer. I have four years of experience with Ableton Live and two years with Avid Pro Tools. I use a number of third-party plugins from NI’s Massive to U-He Diva and iZotope Ozone as well.</p>
		<p>What excites me most about production is collaboration with others. There is no better feeling than sitting down with a musician and sensing chemistry between their ideas and mine. My ultimate goal every time I start a project is to translate musical ideas into a fully-realized track that is both original and professional.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>I listened to mostly metal and hardcore in middle and high school before being exposed to electronic music. I was especially drawn to experimental acts like Flying Lotus that blur the lines between hip-hop and its various subgenres. I began collecting hardware samplers and records and attending shows in the greater Boston area. What started as a casual interest quickly became a full-time pursuit.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Since then, I have produced dozens of tracks, exchanged project files with collaborators across the world, and DJed a handful of events and parties. I am currently exploring interactive web technology as a means of creating a more immersive audiovisual experience.</p>
